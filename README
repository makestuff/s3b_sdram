Moving towards a simple SDRAM controller. The simulations use GHDL & GTKWave. Unfortunately the
versions of GTKWave in most Linux distributions are buggy, so it's necessary to build it from
source. The build-gtkwave.sh script will help with that.

pcb - The Eagle design files for the SDRAM daughterboard.
try1 - Sanity check. Initialise the SDRAM, activate a row, do four writes followed by a read.
